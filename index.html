              <h1>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.</h1>
              <p>
                I'm Christine, a Software Developer and medical Speech-Language
                Pathologist (SLP) based in Las Vegas, NV. As a healthcare
                professional and avid rock climber, I love to help people and
                solve problems! One of my long term goals is to utilize my
                evolving skills to improve tech accessibility for people with
                communication disorders and other marginalized communities.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            After obtaining my master's in Speech-Language Pathology, I worked
            in post-acute rehabilitation, inpatient, and outpatient settings.
            Through this field, I have had the privilege of helping diverse
            people with swallowing and communication disorders. I am especially
            passionate about working with people with aphasia (a language
            disorder acquired after neurological injury).
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned software development because I've seen how not everyone is
            able to reap the benefits of the powerful and rapidly advancing
            technology that is available today. I wanted to be able to help fill
            that gap and build solutions for these populations because they are
            so much more capable given the access and the right tools.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Given my unique perspective and skill-set, I am able to offer the
            following services:

                TakeCharge is a health care log app targeted for patients who
                may not be tech savvy, health literate, and/or whose health care
                providers do not all use the same patient portal. Users can save
                and manage information related to their health care providers,
                visits, and recommendations in a way that THEY can understand.
                The patient, their caregiver, or their provider can quickly type
                the information into designated areas throughout the app, using
                only language that is appropriate for the patient. As a simple,
                user-friendly app, patients can keep this information easily
                accessible at their fingertips.
              </p>
              <p>
                As my first fullstack capstone, I was excited to strengthen my
                skills by building an app for the communities I want to serve. I
                would love to learn more about encryption and cyber security to
                protect sensitive information and be HIPAA compliant.

                BetaVzn was made for rock climbers! They can search for boulder
                problems based on location and grade. The user can add
                additional search filters, including minimum grade, maximum
                grade, and number of results to display. The feature that makes
                this app unique is its consolidation of Mountain Project
                information and relevant YouTube videos. The app will return a
                list of boulder problems and display the following information
                for a single result: Name of the boulder problem, grade, a link
                to Mountain Project page, and embedded YouTube videos.
              </p>
              <p>
                Building this app taught me how understand API documentation and
                use APIs to fetch data and essentially give LIFE to my apps!

                Noteful is a simple note taking app that allows the user to
                create, save, and edit notes using custom folders. Building this
                app taught me how to build a fullstack application using ReactJS
                for the client-side app, Express for the server, and PostgreSQL
                for the database. I learned how to deploy each part of the app
                to arrive at this live project.

                This is a Studio Ghibli Quiz that tests how much the user knows
                about the Japanese animation studio. This quiz will tell the
                user if their answer was correct, keep score as they progress
                through the quiz, display their results at the end, and allow
                them to restart the quiz. Building this app allowed me to
                practice using jQuery to make a webpage interactive.
